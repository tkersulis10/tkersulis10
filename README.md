### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my profile! I am an aspriring data analyst and machine learning engineer. I am an undergraduate student at Cornell University pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science with minors in Business and Operations Research and Information Engineering.

Below you can find some of the projects that I have created:

- Fantasy-Football-ML-Simulation: Simulating and modeling fantasy football drafts and predicting future production using a neural network
- Prop-Betting-Machine-Learning-Project: Using machine learning to predict and analyze NBA prop bets
- Interactive-SQL-Database-Using-OCaml: Creating a database in OCaml that takes in SQL commands from a self-created CLI
- Deep-Learning-Handwritten-Digits-Testing: Testing different hyperparameter choices in a convolutional neural network to predict handwritten digits
